     <help>Normally the number of folds is set to 10 (10 fold cross validation). Setting the number of folds to 10 means that 90% of the data is used as training data to build a random forest and the remaining 10% of the data is used as testing data to obtain the classification accuracy of the random forest. This training-testing process is done 10 times in total with each time using a different 90% of the data as training data and the rmaining 10% of the data as testing data.

<help>
The input data is a Linked2Safety data cube in csv format. A number of decision trees (3 by default) are randomly built from the input data using Random Forest algorithm and association rules are extracted from the decision trees.
